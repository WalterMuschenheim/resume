title: About Me
---

I am a language professional and front-end developer. My background in translation has given me an approach to problem solving that is both systematic and creative. When I started building websites I was interested in design and layout. After becoming familiar with Wordpress, I began to dive deeper into customizing themes and plugins, which lead to my current interest in coding and full-stack development.
